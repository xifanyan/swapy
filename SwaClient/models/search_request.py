    # Specify a restriction using a joined collection. The argument is expected to be of the form <targetFieldID>:<query>. Example: doc_author_id:office="New York" fired against a documents collection might restrict the result to all documents for which the author has an office in New York. The <targetFieldID> id refers to a field which is the target of a configured join. Joins are configured in the 'Dynamic join' section of the meta-engine configuration. The <query> is the query to be run as a restriction on the source collection in order to limit the results on the target (should be URI-encoded). Some remarks: 1. In the case of using the query for a filter value request: Since dynamic join restrictions influence the result set, and hence the counts, they should be supplied independent of the filter selected. 2. A requests of sorts { joinRestriction=doc_author_id:office=A, query=york } is equivalent to query=york AND doc_author_id.find(office=A), i.e. joinRestriction=<targetFieldID>:<query> and the query syntax <targetFieldID>find(<query>) are equivalent. 3. For meta engine projects, <targetFieldID> is valid independent of the collectionId (i.e. you can use collectionId=people and a <targetFieldID> which is in the people collection).

    # The query expression. Such a query expression (also known as 'main query') contains simple word matches like 'York', implicit phrases like 'New York', explicit phrases like '"An explicit phrase"', fielded searches, boolean expression like 'berlin and vacation', containing near operators etc. Multiple expressions can be submitted with AND semantics (can also be seen as a 'search in' of the second expression in the first expression). Field-based expressions must respect the fields configured for the selected projectId/collectionId. Specifying this value as GET parameter requires the usual URI encoding. Note that field-based-searches for date fields support '<', '=', '>', '<=', '>=' just as for numeric values; the accepted values are either the milli seconds since 1970 followed by 'L' or a (partial) date pattern as specified in the singleMindServer configuration. Please refer to the reference manual for more details. Use 'NOT *' if you want to match no documents. Default query is '*', i.e. no query restriction.
